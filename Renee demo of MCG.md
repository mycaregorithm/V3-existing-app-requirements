Speaker 1  (00:03)
Dance recording. 

Speaker 2  (00:04)
It's just it now. Okay, so I'm currently loved in as a position as you can see, based on seeing my cases down here at the bottom. If I were logged in as a support staff member, this would be a completely clear screen. 

Speaker 2  (00:20)
And you would only be able to use these search feature in order to find one of the many cases within your organisation support Team members have access to all cases. Within an organisation, physicians can only see their own cases. We have currently 19 modules. 

Speaker 2  (00:40)
Kind of thing. I'm amazing honestly, the one that I haven't. We done all the best. 

Speaker 2  (00:46)
So currently I know this is a bug. I don't know what happened, but Physician and NP I should utopopulate for the physician. It should not for support staff for some reason that has changed and the I know you reality. 

Speaker 2  (01:04)
We've talked about it, but the support staff one didn't change. So I'm not really sure what happened there. Umm. 

Speaker 2  (01:12)
So this should auto populate for me. I didn't. It didn't, so I've now updated it. 

Speaker 2  (01:18)
I currently logged into the PHI version. I 

Speaker 3  (01:23)
They are currently on the patient ID page In the referring to the physician mpi field in the physician name field should be auto populating capture that 

Speaker 2  (01:38)
I can go through the non TI leader just to confirm for you, but um, you can see him in the I, because I'm able to type in first last email and MRN and also a specific data of birth in non PHI, this is just an age range. Um, let me just put in some general info. 

Speaker 2  (02:22)
These 2 really don't get you all that often. They should be free text in Uh, in the PHI version, a non pray. Anything that is free text is numeric only instead of alph numeric. 

Speaker 2  (02:36)
Um. The notes feature should also be disabled within the non PHI version. Then if I go to diagnosis and staging. 

Speaker 2  (02:48)
Full screen, I think we've gone over that plenty of times those issues with that. Currently, but full screen should not close out for anything. Except for when you are going into the browser itself to exit full screen clicking this or hitting the escape button, I know at 1 point, there is an issue where when you'd click the home. 

Speaker 2  (03:07)
Button, it would cause full screen to exit out. That should not happen. 

Speaker 3  (03:13)
Full screen has been fixed capture that 

Speaker 2  (03:17)
Sure, labels should default fun at all times through all modules. The default photo of all of the modules I think we've had discussions about this, and we've decided it would be best just to leave it on the first image. There's also been discussions around, should it be A different image per module, but for now, image one should just be the default across all I know, loosen this in 

Speaker 3  (03:48)
The default image should be the first one on, all capture that 

Speaker 2  (03:56)
Yesterday's demo, but the current default sizing of the tumours and nose, is really, really big. I think this is about the size that it should start off at. But it's also going to depend on the module. 

Speaker 2  (04:10)
So this was about the size that they did start off on before the update to this new version of diagnosis and staging. 

Speaker 1  (04:21)
I'm just making a note to check here. 

Speaker 2  (04:24)
No, worries, one of the things that I did send back to you a couple minutes ago was the ticket for this one. So tumour, it should actually read tumour as the default, same as it says, no, not T1. Um, that's 

Speaker 1  (04:40)
Curious about that. I was actually curious about that, because I actually thought maybe no was broken but it is tumour, that's broken. So 

Speaker 2  (04:50)
Yeah, okay. So let's see what else drawings. This all I mean, we've talked about these before, but everything should stay where they are, depending on whichever image you're looking at. 

Speaker 2  (05:08)
Group stage, this also shows up Well, that was really Okay, well, it should stay a lot of a photo and leave it on when I'm choosing a different group stage. Um, but. Yeah, group stage. 

Speaker 3  (05:28)
She just noticed A Image drawns. Moving from Aboriginal image to another image that is a bug that I need to put in capture that 

Speaker 2  (05:44)
Age, any of the stages over here should show up in the age box as well. This is the correct info. The only thing that's missing is the it's called a label. 

Speaker 2  (05:55)
I think it's technically supposed to be either value or stage as you would call it a tumour stage. I don't know what's going on right now. Um, but so the tumour and no should also show up on stage. 

Speaker 2  (06:08)
I know that we have a ticket in for that. Currently, so I'm not going to go into that super Deep. 

Speaker 3  (06:27)
Rene is talking about the tumour in node. Annotations, that can be added to an image It seems that she wants it or is inferring that it needs to go in the patient section under stage. Along with the M0M1 Need a follow-up on that capture. 

Speaker 3  (06:56)
That. 

Speaker 2  (07:00)
Endo, radio all seems to be working fine for the most part. Um, extent for that, we knew about that one already. Treatment plan. 

Speaker 2  (07:14)
Honestly, this looked really good. I just finished. I closed out the ticket for the work that had been done on this one pretty last night's push. 

Speaker 2  (07:22)
This is what it should look like with the 2 rose up top of 6 each and we do try to keep it to a maximum of 12. We like lossages EOP elements whatever we want to call them. Jocely sees, even if we don't have to scroll, that is the one major requirement that is consistently been told to us as Liu does not want physicians to have to scroll once they have to scroll, it gets messy. 

Speaker 3  (07:53)
Scrolling, no scrolling, as much as possible. Capture that 

Speaker 2  (07:57)
They won't do it. The only exception to this that I can think of is on the mayawatient, ID page the expert physician, who were trying to get to pilot, that module specifically, asked for excuse me, a tonne of different fields to be added, and you could see those in test right now. On the milema module, so that's the only exception that we've made thus far 

Speaker 3  (08:24)
Review my aluma. In verify, what Rene is referring to capture that 

Speaker 2  (08:31)
And Lew actually hadn't even seen what those changes look like. So he might be wary of it, even that Okay, also, the next steps pages. He seems to be okay with, but that might just be because we haven't had a full conversation about it. 

Speaker 2  (08:49)
So tvd on this rolling on that one. Okay, anything on treatment plan. Next steps that isn't kind of self-explanatory. 

Speaker 2  (09:00)
There should be multi select. You can do as many as you need to. There should be as many, so these are the elements of the plan, yoke lossengers. 

Speaker 2  (09:10)
Whatever you want to call them, the clients call them buttons, you should be able to select as many of them on one step as you want within an option. But you can't put more than one of the same lausin on the same step. Sorry, obviously I just tried to put thethology review on the same one. 

Speaker 2  (09:30)
It already has and do that. We put it on the next one that's fine, you should be able to 

Speaker 3  (09:36)
There is rule logic on the treatment plan page where you cannot duplicate the same treatment on the same step. So, for example, step 2 can only have imaging on there. Once you cannot add imaging again. 

Speaker 3  (09:53)
Capture that. 

Speaker 2  (09:55)
Able to add up to 15 steps. And up to 7 options. 

Speaker 3  (10:03)
Can add up to 15 steps and 7 options capture that 

Speaker 2  (10:09)
Within each step, you should be able to add notes for the PG. I version, not for the nogi, because you can obviously add PHI into the notes, so there shouldn't be any notesbox on not PHI and then you can also leave a step blank and just add a note, and it should still show up and save with just that note it shouldn't be left, actually blank. What else 

Speaker 3  (10:39)
Oh, the notes will follow the treatment plans to the compare options page. Capture that 

Speaker 2  (10:47)
Something I did notice while I was doing some testing and saving earlier today. If I were to save this as is or even without option 2 there, if I even add 1 step to option one, it seems to default to selecting option one as the preference. 

Speaker 1  (11:07)
That was how you see my question was, yes, and I didn't know. If that was, if it just always by default selected one I was going to ask you what the what the reason for the checkboxes are is that where a patient goes in looks at it and says, well, this is the option I want to go with for my treatment. 

Speaker 2  (11:25)
No. So the patient will in their role, they should not be able to change or select anything. The only things that they should be able to click through are the tabs themselves and then the resources section to open up and see those resources and videos. 

Speaker 2  (11:40)
So this is for when the patient and the care team are discussing the different options, the doctor can say, okay, so after having this conversation or you know, with my professional opinion, I'm going to suggest option number one for you. Take this home, think about it. However, you need to and we do find that these options are very sticky in patient's mind. 

Speaker 2  (12:06)
So they'll call back. And they'll say, okay, yeah, I want to do option. Number two actually, I think that's probably going to be the best option for me. 

Speaker 2  (12:14)
So it should not deprect if it's left blank, it should just be blank. Okay, I'll put a second after that. 

Speaker 1  (12:22)
If you haven't already 

Speaker 2  (12:24)
Now I just been collecting more and more. I tried to do them in groups. Um, okay. 

Speaker 2  (12:31)
So resources it should default to the highlighted resources age. If there's nothing here. It's just like Clinical trials, I'm trying to think of exactly what each thing should look like. 

Speaker 2  (12:47)
So all resources are the static resources should have. This print button, it should be functional. You know what opens up the little print popout and have the options to save this PDF, and Uh, one note I think, and then also just print itself. 

Speaker 2  (13:06)
So that's the one thing I wanted to point up there. You can favourite highlight whatever you want to call it, and those should always show up here once saved, they should still show up here. All of our videos, if you do see anything that you're like. 

Speaker 2  (13:22)
Hey Something is spelled wrong in any of the camptions the like display names or Something is odd like the drug therapy video is showing up in radiation therapy or side effects, or something like that. Just let me know if I can fix that in the abdent tool pretty quickly. Okay, yeah, so you know, the physician or the care team might highlight a couple of resources for the patient to go back and review at a later time or that they have reviewed with the patient while in the clinic. 

Speaker 2  (13:59)
You should also be able to search within each category. So if I go to drug therapy, and I'm looking up specifically the drugs to splat in, I'll see it here, I can open it up, I can highlight it, and it will still show up here. I don't think you can search. 

Speaker 2  (14:13)
Yeah, you can't search within the highlighted resources. I don't know if we have plans to update that. It feels like a short but like easy fix, but they're also I don't expect there to be a lot of highlighted resources to begin with. 

Speaker 2  (14:30)
So I'm not really sure on that one. 

Speaker 1  (14:34)
I put a note, I, you know. 

Speaker 2  (14:38)
I can always ask, yeah, and then I do. Remember. Asking why we had this like little title up here when you're on the page. 

Speaker 2  (14:47)
And I think the answer that I received was basically if it's blank, then it just tells the user, oh, Hey, this isn't just a blank screen like not things, it's not that things aren't loading? It's just that the highlighted resources you haven't added anything. But think if I delete all of these echoes away Yes, I'm not really sure. 

Speaker 2  (15:08)
If that's a bug or what's supposed to happen here to be very honest with you, it was a while ago I'd asked that question. And it was under our previous leadership, so it might be worth asking the question again. Um. 

Speaker 3  (15:28)
We are moving into the next steps page, capture that 

Speaker 1  (15:33)
Hello, up on all the other resources I'm sorry. 

Speaker 2  (15:36)
No, I'm a general biology. Rare, because it's the only one that would technically be blank. Uh at 1 point, because everything else, if a category shows up here it has at least one resource in it, otherwise we just wouldn't add it in, but then it doesn't, I don't hear when it's like so I'm not really sure. 

Speaker 2  (15:57)
I know there also is a ticket in the backlog for kind of a future functionality to be able to search through all categories instead of just individual. Oh, and one particular thing. I hope it doesn't regress ever cause that would really not make Liu happy. 

Speaker 2  (16:14)
But when you're in a specific category and you type something. If you then move to another category, it should clear. Of course, highlighted resources just works different in general, which is why it didn't clear when I did that last time. 

Speaker 2  (16:28)
So yeah, that should always clear when you're moving. 

Speaker 3  (16:33)
We went back to the resources page. She's talking about the search functionality capture that 

Speaker 2  (16:41)
To the different categories that search actually works in 

Speaker 3  (16:46)
We're moving on to the next steps. 

Speaker 2  (16:49)
Next steps, these should all now that we've updated them. They should all be pretty standardised with this. 

Speaker 3  (16:59)
When we talk about next steps, we're referring to A Fees in the process of the communication to a patient. 

Speaker 2  (17:17)
Theme. Layouts of scheduled treatment options are first additional appointments. Schedule test procedure referrals to other positions and other, with some changes to the sub options. 

Speaker 2  (17:32)
And then they should all each have in other as well, for anything kind of a catch. All that was missed. Again, for phire, you should be able to select as many of these as needed. 

Speaker 2  (17:42)
They'll save and update properly. And then you also have notes that pop out. So, you know, maybe there's a doctor Smith that you're referring with a patient too. 

Speaker 2  (17:50)
Maybe you want them to go and obtain outside medical records from their primary care. Maybe they need to go for CT imaging. Um, or there's a particular reason to see a social worker or nutrition like dietian specialist. 

Speaker 2  (18:11)
Maybe it's a date or time in here. So these again, these are all notes boxes should be available in PHI in non PHI. They don't show up at all. 

Speaker 2  (18:20)
It's not even that they are numeric, only they just don't show 

Speaker 1  (18:28)
What is the non PHI version? 

Speaker 2  (18:33)
Um. 

Speaker 1  (18:34)
What time is that? 

Speaker 2  (18:39)
Just for this page or just in general. 

Speaker 1  (18:43)
Well, you've mentioned a PHI and a non PHI version multiple times throughout the tabs. Is there like another? Is there another role or a flip of the switch on a specific roll? 

Speaker 1  (18:57)
Where you can see a less I guess unless um. 

Speaker 2  (19:09)
Yeah, it's not a switch from rolls. There's all the same rules it's actually you might have to ask will for the better terminology, but I would consider it a different type of organisation. Because we still have all the same environments, like you can go into a non PHI organisation within test. 

Speaker 2  (19:32)
And within proud. And I'll show you, I'll show you what the non PHI version looks like. In a second, here, I'll go for this again. 

Speaker 2  (19:41)
Just to kind of show you the differences so she receive again. Each fox should follow through with all the same info I think the only Paget doesn't show up on is compare options. This logo and message can change depending on the organisation that you're in. 

Speaker 2  (20:00)
Obviously this is what it looks like right now because I'm in the my characterm organisation, qgi organisation, but if we're in the OSU organisation, their logos up here, we haven't changed this. Because they didn't say they wanted to, they said, no, let's leave it for now. Umm. 

Speaker 3  (20:20)
When she's referring to this, we're on the share page. Where the centre of the screen from top to bottom, we have the mychagorithm logo. Then it says, please verify the patient's email address. 

Speaker 3  (20:36)
Thank you, and it has a box field for email input, and then 2 button boxes below that says, save this case and share this case, capture that 

Speaker 2  (20:50)
And then you should also be able to type the patient email here. This was also an issue at 1. You should be able to type it here and on the patient idp. 

Speaker 2  (20:58)
So if something happens, there That's a repression. I'm still a physician, so I should have both buttons saved and share this case. All other sport team members at this point should only save not share. 

Speaker 2  (21:13)
However, I have received feedback from multiple customers that doesn't make total sense a lot of times the physician wants their nurse or just one of their other team members to do it for them, they don't want to have to log in again to do it. 

Speaker 3  (21:30)
Capture that needing to allow other staff to be able to share cases not restricted to physician. 

Speaker 2  (21:38)
So that might change soon enough. Um, and if I go to notes, so this only fills out with the record, ID once safe, I didn't click the button, so it's not going to do that. The information below was discussed with, and it gets filled-out with The name if I didn't include a name. 

Speaker 2  (22:00)
I think it just says discus with the patient on the date. The this needs to change for certain modules. The wording gets a little off, because so it does the age range or the age itself. 

Speaker 2  (22:19)
Uh, sex. And Reece with a diagnosis of the pathology and of the anatonic disease site, sometimes the anatonic disease site is just worded differently depending on the options that we give them. So if I go back here, it 

Speaker 3  (22:37)
She's referring to the final page notes and the diagnosis section, and she's gone back to that patient ID. And she's selecting the different types of pathology. 

Speaker 2  (22:55)
It might say tonsel, left as well. So it's up with mesoference tonsel - left, so that is kind of funky, but that's Further down on the list of issues that we're having, so, you know, it works for now. Sometimes it also just says of the left. 

Speaker 2  (23:16)
Because it's just assumed that it's breast or brain, or whatever it is. So it's, yeah, it's a little, it's a little wanky with the anatomic disease, right? Initial diagnosis should Basically, look, as is when there are those right side fields on the diagnosis and staging page, they also show up here under initial diagnosis. 

Speaker 2  (23:36)
Since it's basically just more of those kinds of questions, we just didn't want them scrolling. So they got pushed over to the next page. Stage should show here again with timmerant node steging. 

Speaker 2  (23:50)
Uhi, dependent on the sex. There was a lot of conversation around this in general. But this was how it ended up saying. 

Speaker 2  (24:03)
This should never change 

Speaker 1  (24:07)
Does it stay that way even if they are like drinking? 

Speaker 2  (24:09)
Transender. Well, that's part of the conversation that was had. So It's completely dependent on sex. 

Speaker 2  (24:19)
I said, I'm not, it should just be v, and we just shouldn't worry about it period but It was not the final decision, so it's not based on the gender of these monsecs. Um, I lost. 

Speaker 1  (24:36)
Battle at my last medical company, to 

Speaker 2  (24:39)
Yeah, especially in the current political climate. Um, it's whoever is in church. Some. 

Speaker 2  (24:46)
Yeah, I get it. These so basically, from here onwards, this should all look exactly the same in every notes page that we have treatment plan options. Should look as they do currently with any notes showing up you can see here like this. 

Speaker 2  (25:06)
So if I had added a no on that particular step, it will show up right here at the end, in kind of italics, and then the actual note, these are all of the sub elements after each of the elements themselves. There's also been some issues there, so want to point that out specifically. Okay, this should also look the same at every notes with the next steps listed and again, any notes listed the same as they look on the treatment plan. 

Speaker 2  (25:37)
We answered all the patients, questions to the best of our ability. Visual content was made available to the patient. And then this is something that needs to be updated. 

Speaker 2  (25:47)
I think will has a ticket for that. He's working on right now. It should start by saying this information was shown to the patient on the deep. 

Speaker 2  (25:56)
Because if it says email before it's even been email, then that could cause some concern or chaos. 

Speaker 3  (26:04)
So we're still talking about the notes page, which is basically A Final update of what has been done in this patient's profile. In the discussion with the provider on the footter, it has this information with email to John dough on a date. So there is some logic that is predetermining information for this page that needs to be researched, capture that 

Speaker 2  (26:33)
And then this is just our okays, he notice, so The only thing actually, that I think it's added to this, and I will go back and change it just to see Yeah, so after discussing this new, this becomes a new sentence that gets added. Once you do choose, we express our preference for option. The I don't know what's going on with that, because I thought it got fixed and then I think it got reverted in the last push. 

Speaker 2  (27:07)
It's obviously numeric options, not ABC. So I don't know what's going on with that. 

Speaker 1  (27:16)
I will put a ticket 

Speaker 2  (27:17)
Important. UI don't know, I'm not sure going on, but you should be able to download this page. It comes up as a Word document, you can also print it. 

Speaker 2  (27:30)
Um, should have your hello and meme. And obviously log out button our logo. It will always be here. 

Speaker 2  (27:40)
Um. I also talking to work, because there was something going on with the are you share motel? Where I would make changes, I would save it. 

Speaker 2  (27:48)
And then as I was trying to go back to the homepage from the share page. I'm sure you saw the same thing. It was asking me about. 

Speaker 2  (27:54)
I'd seeing I did just, I didn't do anything. 

Speaker 1  (27:58)
Yeah, no I have seen it too, but I haven't been like it. It's like it's intermittently happening. And I'm like, well, darn it, I can't catch it on the, you know, when you get recording started, it doesn't 

Speaker 2  (28:11)
Average drop, it seems those are the worst frustrating. Yeah, okay. So a couple of things before I go onto the non PHI version. 

Speaker 2  (28:21)
This is obviously the my Loma module. These 2 logos should always be sat next to each other the way they are no matter the organisation. Because we partnered with LS who's now blood cancers, united to Create the module, so this should always have their branding. 

Speaker 3  (28:43)
So LLS stands for leukemia, in lymphoma society, and the logo that Rene is referring to is on the header next to the mygorithm logo. Capture that. 

Speaker 2  (29:02)
You can see right now. You really don't have to scroll in order to see everything like it all fits in the one page, but when you go and look at this module on test, it's a lot more information. And yeah, Leo hasn't seen that one yet. 

Speaker 2  (29:15)
So we're not sure what it will look like. I'd have noticed with Foley's update. 

Speaker 3  (29:24)
We are talking about a new cancer module called my We just talked about the patient. ID information page where it has to scroll Didn't go over any other details within it. Now we are on the diagnosis and staging page. 

Speaker 2  (29:46)
It's to this page, you do have to scroll, and you can't even get to some of the final images here, these should basically all these should be approximately or 12 or 13 images. I don't know what the Max is on the diagosujing, but again I think it's a cross modules, so you'd have 

Speaker 3  (30:05)
She's referring to the images that are below the primary image that allows you to click through The different views of the body part that's been talked about. 

Speaker 2  (30:21)
I have to confirm with Foley, and Anto. Will So this one is slightly different. I know we have some other modules that have more than 8 images. 

Speaker 2  (30:36)
But The ultimate goal here would be, for these to all be in one line as they were before. So that's one of the things that's getting edited there. Yeah, what else? 

Speaker 2  (30:51)
My loana specific I think that was the only thing that I wanted to show on that one okay and then you should still be able to move these around dependent on, you know, if you're like, okay, well, I'm really only 

Speaker 3  (31:08)
Now she's back on the homepage. Looking at the existing cases Grid, and she's referring to being able to move the columns around 

Speaker 2  (31:21)
We're going to search my position my first name. I don't think these stay unfortunately. It would be nice if they did, but I think as soon as you log out, they do switch back to their default. 

Speaker 2  (31:37)
Um I don't think that's been ticketed or even noticed by anyone. But I asked it, yeah, okay. 

Speaker 1  (31:46)
Yeah, I noticed it. Because I was like, well, it would be better if I could do it this way. And then I think I actually opened up a case, and I went back, and I was like, why did it 

Speaker 2  (31:55)
Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 1  (31:58)
But in a suggestion for it 

Speaker 2  (32:01)
Ohh, okay. So I will show you, I'll show you the non pea, try and then I'll show you from the patient where it should look like. 

Speaker 2  (32:19)
Oh. Oh, no, that's weird. 

Speaker 1  (32:23)
Banks or that account doesn't have access. 

Speaker 2  (32:28)
Um, that I only ever used to get when my IP address changed. But we updated some settings and stuff. So that hasn't happened in a really long time. 

Speaker 2  (32:45)
Australians can All rights, I'm going to need to contact fully. That's really weird. I was just in this yesterday, as I was testing in the non phra. 

Speaker 2  (33:01)
Okay, well, um, I guess I'll show you in test, not PHI. I can remember which one I'm in a test. I have a whole less written down of exactly which account corresponds to what role in organisation could survivals actually, my mind? 

Speaker 1  (33:27)
It's understandable. 

Speaker 1  (33:40)
Um, do you know whether or why doesn't have you go through the same authentication processes as test as A house. Um, like, for instance, every time I log into um. Test, I have to get my cell phone and use the off app. 

Speaker 2  (34:03)
Um, I don't proud me, should do it once a day test. I For me, at least it feels like it's always the same, except for when I'm using a non my korithm email like this and then it makes me do like the code that gets sent to my email. 

Speaker 1  (34:23)
Okay, I'll have to hook out a little bit more. 

Speaker 2  (34:30)
Okay, so mum PHI, I'm currently locked in as a physician. M. Oh, this was not upried, so I am alive, isn't it? 

Speaker 2  (34:48)
Yeah, this is prad, so this okay, am logged in here is a trainee, slash describe. So completely empty here MRN last name and first name rate out, just to show that it's the non PHI version. I think if I say I'm trying to think of what I might have. 

Speaker 3  (35:08)
She's in the non PHI version of the application and she's referring to the grade out areas in the existing case grid, where they can search patient information and to open up an existing case. 

Speaker 2  (35:26)
Casism, here yeah, there we go. So Same thing you should be able to see this general information. You can move these around, depending on what you'll use. 

Speaker 2  (35:36)
You can see by the physician name, you can look up by the physician, since there's multiple of these, I don't remember whose physicians in here. Probably myself. What's I had no idea who's a position in here. 

Speaker 2  (35:56)
I just saw Steve. So Okay, Steve um, usually when people do buy the non phire version. So basically the reason we created a non PHI For organisations to option into is whether they have super strict security regulations. 

Speaker 2  (36:20)
So Pi is the one we're always going to fight for it's the best version of the product. Non PHI is much more restrictive, as you can even tell. Just now, you know, you can't add any patient health information, anything to even search by it makes it much more difficult on the team itself. 

Speaker 2  (36:38)
This can't be emailed to the patients. It's really just for in clinic use, so it's much more difficult to use. Really. 

Speaker 2  (36:48)
So I'm just going to open one of these It should all look basically the same. Have not. Here's the options. 

Speaker 2  (36:59)
So I'll say misdie, I'm then support staff. So I have to choose from the list that's working as expected. This is an issue. 

Speaker 2  (37:09)
I should not be able to like this should not look like this. Patient. Emirate should look like first same last game. 

Speaker 2  (37:15)
I remember telling me about it, but I don't know if the I don't think a ticket ever got created, because it was over the last month here when things have been a little chaotic. It looks like Thank you. It looks like you should be able to type. 

Speaker 2  (37:31)
I am trying out and I can't so that's at least good. But, yeah, none of these 4 options should be available. They shall be great out like this. 

Speaker 2  (37:38)
And so should the notes 

Speaker 3  (37:42)
She's referring to in the greater options. The patient first name patient last name patient email and notes are great out. 

Speaker 2  (37:50)
Something. 

Speaker 1  (37:51)
The note should be grown up to 

Speaker 2  (37:53)
Notes should also be great out. Yeah. Any place where possible PHI could be input? 

Speaker 2  (38:02)
It should also be an aged range to select from same-sex. Gender race, anatonic disease sites should all be the same. All these should be the same other characteristics. 

Speaker 2  (38:15)
You'll see, I'm trying to type none here. I can't type anything alumberic. And then as soon as you type a one decimal Oh, I gotta stopped you at some point. 

Speaker 2  (38:29)
But yeah. You should only be able to type what death symbol basically and no other no commerce or anything like that. Yeah, all right. 

Speaker 2  (38:41)
Next Should I'll be the same here? Nothing different same information in the each box. Treatment plan all looks basically the same. 

Speaker 2  (38:54)
You can have all the same sub elements. Everything should be able to add multi select all of it. There's no notes box again, though. 

Speaker 2  (39:03)
Same number of options available up to 7, up to 15 steps within each option. Again should not default anything you can still select whichever you need to Resources should still have the ability of the search bar within each category. All the same resources highlighting capabilities. 

Speaker 2  (39:26)
Next up should all be the same, no notes box. And then the notes themselves is where it looks. It should look the same. 

Speaker 2  (39:36)
But obviously without patient information. So information below is discussed with just the patient of the date. Impression depends on how much you put into that first page, that patient within the age range. 

Speaker 2  (39:53)
Earn, sentences seem set up of every of all the rest of the information, and then this one is correct Vs this information was shown on. And then it gets changed to the information was saved to instead of saying, it was emailed because you can't email We are able to download and print. This is what we recommend if people are using the non PHI, which most of our non PHI users right now, are pilot studies so that they're anonymised. 

Speaker 2  (40:23)
But we do I was thinking, yeah, we do. Tell them that they can use this page if they want to send something home with their patient that day since they can't email same thing, resources can also be printed statue resources. I think that's the majority of the differences in on PHI. 

Speaker 2  (40:42)
I feel like there was something else that I thought of and forgot to say. No, I'm not sure. Any questions I know? 

Speaker 2  (40:54)
You asked a few wild, and gone throws, they need to keep doing it that way. I 

Speaker 1  (41:01)
Um, so in order for me to be able to get access to a non PHI version for testing, I would just need to speak with, you, said, will 

Speaker 2  (41:14)
No, so right and Tuesday. Once you don't hear Um, it's just that it changes your organisation. That's the thing. 

Speaker 2  (41:23)
So I can change it for you same as I change your role. So I would go in here at it. And then instead of just changing this, I know, keep it that position, and then I'll change it to whatever the The non Pi version is, so it would be the expert faculty. 

Speaker 2  (41:41)
That's the one we have in prad to do the testing, which is what I was trying to get into just now. I don't know. 

Speaker 1  (41:51)
The Yancy's dropdown menu on the recording. 

Speaker 2  (41:56)
Oh, really thought. 

Speaker 1  (41:57)
Okay, I'm assuming that's a drop now. Menu. 

Speaker 2  (42:00)
Yeah, yeah, that's so funny. Yeah, it basically just has all of our customers. On it so, and you can see it has like the name and pilot. 

Speaker 2  (42:08)
If it's one of the nod oceans, except for this one cause I don't see, we know. It's not Pi. Yeah, so yeah, I guess that's An overview, and then I want to show you the patient I know you created a patient case for yourself. 

Speaker 2  (42:26)
I saw your added in there as that role. 

Speaker 1  (42:36)
Um, I don't know if I created it, or if it just showed up. But that is the email that I created in order to test out the, you know, email. 

Speaker 2  (42:45)
All capabilities. Yeah, so patients should still have all full screen access. This is no longer home. 

Speaker 2  (42:56)
It's called cases, and it should just bring you to the screen of all of your cases. If it's only one, it just shows the one and it's those that are only related to course. The email address that you've added as I explain whatever I show this particular Peach everyone I took a historical figure. 

Speaker 2  (43:16)
I don't mind multiple different types of cancer. So please excuse the name of the patient. Um, but you can see this is all within the Ohio state test organisation, so it has different physicians from the ork, but only within the ork you can't give the same patient a different ork, which is a whole other can of forms or trying to figure out how to do that now, too. 

Speaker 2  (43:44)
I'm sure you've seen that weather. Do 

Speaker 1  (43:49)
I was going to ask if there's a reason why they don't have a patient and Moran is that, because, for safety purposes, for them. 

Speaker 2  (43:56)
I actually don't know about that oneI wonder if something got Changed, cause, I'm pretty sure I did put a patient Amer in and I wonder if something happened when this became Not great out, um. Yeah, that is odd, so not really. Sure. 

Speaker 2  (44:19)
They should be able to see all of this information anything. Whether or in obviously only for PHI organisations, but they should be able to see all, they just can't change anything. They should not be able like that. 

Speaker 2  (44:36)
This, I think happened with the updates to the diagnosis and staging cage. For some reason, it just stays blank until you move to another screen, but they should obviously be able to see all the photos and any tumours and nodes that were added. I think again, this was updated and they all kind of got deleted when the change was made. 

Speaker 2  (44:59)
I'm really hoping that didn't happen to actual users, but I have no way to tell Um, they can still see all everything in the age box. It's showing that there are tumours that received. So yeah, I think they got 

Speaker 1  (45:15)
Can you get a full screen quick? 

Speaker 2  (45:18)
And it I want to drink in my cakes now. 

Speaker 1  (45:26)
Yeah, I just know that there's some weird likeness with the canvas. Itself. So I was hoping maybe they would pop back up, and now I know I'm worried 

Speaker 2  (45:36)
Yeah, I don't know, but, um, I don't know if you just saw that. But when I exit, I go to regular, instead of full screen, I can't even change through all the photos. So I read that Yeah. 

Speaker 2  (45:48)
Yeah. But anyhow, you should be able to see everything in the age barx, you should be able to see any drawings created on any images and tumours and node staging, you just can't move any of them or erase. That's why all of the usual buttons over here are gone These aren't more of those initial diagnosis fields. 

Speaker 2  (46:10)
Again, you can see them. You can't change them. Treatment plan should look like this. 

Speaker 2  (46:17)
It should not have any of these up here. They can see everything all of the dropdowns and notes that were added, can't change any of it. I don't know why option for is showing up when there's nothing there. 

Speaker 2  (46:34)
Um, compare options. You can see what the position or the care team selected as the preference during conversation. Resources, they should be able to see all the highlighted, open everything up print for themselves. 

Speaker 2  (46:52)
Uh, we can also search within each of the categories for themselves. Watching all of the videos play them all. 

Speaker 1  (47:04)
Don't loan up as a rectangle. 

Speaker 2  (47:07)
Yeah, it just takes a minute. Sometimes when you 

Speaker 1  (47:10)
I oh okay, okay. 

Speaker 2  (47:12)
Yeah, because I know are like a baker file, so sometimes it takes a minute. Especially in test, as long as proud is working up-to-date, and that's fine. Um, and then lastly, next steps looks as it showed, you can see on the next click. 

Speaker 2  (47:29)
Now, can't click. Okay, so this is what the patient should look like, with obviously those mentions that I've just gone over. Anything else? 

Speaker 2  (47:42)
We can think of 

Speaker 1  (47:45)
Um, not that I can think of it, but it sounds like I need to drive through myself on these various different Accounts also, is there any way for you to be able to ask somebody who has access to a proper hospital, to make sure that those tumours and nodes do not request like that, like what we're seeing. 

Speaker 2  (48:12)
Um. Passively. I think You know what, let's actually let's check this way. 

Speaker 2  (48:20)
So that was 258, and I'm pretty sure that that's the one that I've always used as like, my, I filled everything out. But let's just look through here. Before I 

Speaker 1  (48:37)
Can you open app network settings? 

Speaker 2  (48:41)
Is that the network thing here? Yeah. 

Speaker 1  (48:53)
Can you open up console? Um. Options in there. 

Speaker 2  (49:07)
While they're at least the images are showing at the bottom here Specific for him. 

Speaker 1  (49:12)
Okay, so it seems like it's not loading. At first. 

Speaker 2  (49:21)
I know I would have drawn and put tumours and nodes on at least one of these cases. So if I don't see anything, I'm going to say that yeah, something went wrong and then I can go into the test. My test because I know a lot of these are my test cases and look into test here. 

Speaker 2  (49:40)
Just look through these 

Speaker 1  (49:48)
And yours on tests are missing. Mine remoting earlier, I'll see 

Speaker 2  (50:01)
This is also within the patient's role itself. So there could just be, it could be specific 2 patients. 

Speaker 1  (50:09)
To patients, yeah, um So I need to change my account. It sounds like If I if I'm moving my account between patient or um, you know, between the different roles, how would I create an account or how would I create a ticket or ok, I'm sorry specifically for my account? 

Speaker 2  (50:42)
Asian. 

Speaker 1  (50:43)
That makes sense. 

Speaker 2  (50:45)
Um, as long as you don't, you're not using the same email for both a patient and you're like testing role. Then, you're fine. So if you're only still only using your my career that you know which it looks like you are and you're using your personal one as a patient and going to check it that way, then you shouldn't run into any issues. 

Speaker 2  (51:09)
So you can see there what I did was II just launched out of my contest of my patient account which I have in one email. And I'm going to sign in I need to change this first, so I need to do It changed this one wait, yeah. I didn't have that ridden properly. 

Speaker 2  (51:45)
Um yeah, so this is the one that I was using for. The patient that I looked into an I'm going to go lug into my regular email. Okay. 

Speaker 1  (51:58)
Oh, I see. And it gives you a little code 

Speaker 2  (52:01)
Okay. Yeah. And then if I'm searching for benie hill I don't like that. 

Speaker 2  (52:23)
Oh, that is not good. 

Speaker 1  (52:28)
It is disappearing. 

Speaker 2  (52:30)
Um, I actually don't know because it keeps doing this. I'm trying to open any of my cases I should have access to them. I am in the right organisation. 

Speaker 2  (52:39)
And I'm a scriber trainee, so you should be able to see and access all Um's no physician. And I keep getting this error. No, matter which visa, try to open. 

Speaker 2  (52:58)
My heart. 

Speaker 1  (53:01)
Because I tested those in points. M, okay's not going on the other two. 

Speaker 2  (53:16)
Now So unfortunately, I can't want to see her. I am blocked out of prad. I don't know what that means. 

Speaker 1  (53:29)
I'm asked Foley about that one um.
